MainTitle: Usage of the tool for bibliography management
title: What can I use this tool for?
This tool facilitates the creation and formatting of literature entries. It builds on the ***Template for academic papers***.

The motivation for this was that adjustments to *BibLaTeX* can be very cumbersome and complicated. The scope of functions is roughly summarised as follows:
- Create projects based on the template
- Create and edit literature entries via the web interface.
- You can then easily cite these literature entries in your document.
- Create and edit literature categories via the web interface
- Import your library or individual entries from Citavi
