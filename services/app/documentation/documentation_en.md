MainTitle: Usage of the tool for bibliography management
title: What can I use this tool for?
This tool facilitates the creation and formatting of literature entries. It builds on the ***Template for academic papers***.

The motivation for this was that adjustments to *BibLaTeX* can be very cumbersome and complicated. The scope of functions is roughly summarised as follows:
- Create projects based on the template
- Create and edit literature entries via the web interface.
- You can then easily cite these literature entries in your document.
- Create and edit literature categories via the web interface
- Import your library or individual entries from Citavi

title: What is the best way to get started?
Go to the ***Downloads*** page and download the package for your operating system. When you unzip the downloaded ZIP file, you should see an executable file. Copy this file into the folder where the LaTeX projects are to be created and start it by double-clicking on it.

Now a terminal window will appear in which the application is running. As soon as you close this window, the application is closed. In addition, a folder ***projects*** with a sample project has been created.

If you call up the address ***http://localhost:8448*** in a browser, you should see the application.
