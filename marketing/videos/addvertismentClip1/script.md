# ThesorTeX - use LaTeX more comfortably

You want to write an academic paper, like a thesis or a homework assignment, and want to avoid the struggles of formatting with Microsoft word? Then ThesorTeX might be what you need!

It is designed to take over as much work as possible regarding the formatting of your paper, so you can focus on the content.

To get started, you can download the template for an academic paper on https://thesortex.com. This template meets a lot of the requirements to academic papers, like different chapter numberings, a table of contents, a header and footer and much more.

Perhaps the most significant advantage of this template is the handling of the bibliography. You have the complete control over the information you want to include in your bibliography and cites and over the way they are styled. Refer to the Tutorials on https://thesortex.com to learn more about it.

Admittedly, the way the bibligraphy is configured, might be a little complicated. If you want to do it even more comfortably, you can use the tool for biliography management.

This is a web application you can run locally on your computer. It allows you to configure your bibliography in a web interface. You can style bibliography categories as you wish, create entries for these categories and even import your bibliography from Citavi.

For more information, refer to the tutorials on our website. In case you have some more requirements, refer to the github repository and create an issue there.

We hope, ThesorTeX can ease your process of writing academic papers.
