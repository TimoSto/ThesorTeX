ThesorTeX is designed to help you use LaTeX in the academic context. You can use our LaTeX template for your next assignment or thesis and design your bibliography as you wish, without writing LaTeX code yourself, using the tool for bibliography management.

## Thesis Template

So lets get started with the template.

> Show ToC of the documentation

It was created to meet common requirements, like chapter numbering, a table of contents, the header and footer of a page and many other things. This is basically just regular LaTeX styling, so we won't get much into it here. If you want to learn more, check out the full tutorial video.

What is special about this template, is how the bibliography is handled.

> Bibliography page

This template allows you to customize the styling of your bibliography entries as you wish. To accomplish this, you can style them using regular LaTeX commands.

> Show a simple command

The entries are read from a CSV file, which stands for `Comma separated values`. You can open this file in Microsoft Excel or just in a text editor.

> Show a filled csv file

You can cite an entry using the `key`.

> Show cite command

This process can be quiet complex. That's where the tool for bibliography management comes into play.

## Thesis Tool

> Show animation of entries in gui to csv

This tool allows you to create and style bibliography entries and cites. 

> Show category editor

You can change how the attributes of an entry of a category are inserted into the bibliography and as a cite. 

> Show entry editor

Then you can create an entry, select the category and set values for the attributes.

> Show citavi import

You can also import your bibliography from Citavi.

To learn more about this tool, we have a separate video here.
